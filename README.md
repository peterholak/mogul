An experiment that could one day become a flexible GUI library for Kotlin (JVM and Native) inspired by React.

Too tired to write a proper README right now, stay tuned.

Here's a screenshot, as you can see, it's not practically usable at the moment, but you can already
see how the code using this library [would typically look like](src/mogul/demo/testComponents.kt#L16). Right now the code is pretty hacky, but I will be cleaning that up soon.

If you just want to download a binary to run it, check out the releases github tab.
